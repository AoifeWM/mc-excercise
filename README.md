These problems could have been prevented by making sure that we have constant communication with each other, and making sure that any  little change that was made is cleared and verified with every single team member, and everything is pushed or pulled at the appropriate time. When in doubt, pull before you start working on anything,it won't hurt to check with all of your team members, and it will resolve merge conflicts in the future. 

Make sure all team members laptops are in sync. 

Always make sure to do git pulls before working on any branches or any codes.
